      year&#x02bc;s Cybersecurity Challenge! We&#x02bc;ve worked very hard
      to make this a unique, challenging and fun experience for you, and
      hope you find it such. Before you hit the big yellow button above,
      let&#x02bc;s go through some important things.</p>

      <div class="doc-item" id="overview">
        <h2>Overview of your infrastructure</h2>
        <h3 id="overview-hosts">Vulnerable hosts</h3>
        <p>
        Your infrastructure consist of a service desk web application with
        public and admin side, spread across five hosts:
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><code>db</code></dt>
          <dd>
          Runs a MySQL database which stores user data and service tickets.
          </dd>

          <dt><code>api</code></dt>
          <dd>
          Runs the node.js frontend web API. Communicates with the
          database.
          </dd>

          <dt><code>tickets</code></dt>
          <dd>
          Serves the HTML/JavaScript frontend for the node.js API. Built by
          Angular.
          </dd>

          <dt><code>admin</code></dt>
          <dd>
          Runs the Python admin web API and serves the relevant static
          HTML/JavaScript. Communicates with the database.
          </dd>

          <dt><code>validator</code></dt>
          <dd>
          Runs a simple PHP web server which gets a list of URLs, checks
          them against a list of allowed hosts and returns OK or not OK. It
          requires an API key, which only the Python API on
          <code>admin</code> can get. When admin users login to the admin
          portal and open a message which contains links, they can verify
          the links point to an allowed host by clicking on a button
          (&#x201c;Is this phishy?&#x201d;), which checks them against
          <code>validator</code>.
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <h3 id="overview-LAN">Private network</h3>
        <p>
        All five hosts are on a private subnet within a dedicated virtual
        private cloud (VPC) on AWS. The VPC is unique to you and hosts only
        your infrastructure. There is a public subnet within it as well,
        with two boxes:
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><code>NAT</code></dt>
          <dd>
          The five hosts in the private subnet route via this box in order
          to be able to access the internet. It also runs Nginx which
          routes to the relevant host based on URL. And it also runs
          a connect-back service on port 49001. If you connect to it from
          any of the hosts in the private subnet it will prove that you got
          a shell, and we can detect your RCE persistence, see
          <a href="#scoring-detection" target="_self">Detection</a> below.
          </dd>

          <dt><code>toolbox</code></dt>
          <dd>
          An Ubuntu instance with some useful tools installed on it:
          metasploit, nmap, socat, gcc, docker with the relevant MySQL
          version image pulled already. This machine also has ports
          2645&#x2013;2681 open to the internet; use those for reverse
          shells that connect back. Remember to use the
          <span class="emph">public</span> IP address of the machine. This
          is given to you after deployment (as &#x201c;Toolbox IP&#x201d;).
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <h3 id="overview-cf">CloudFormation template</h3>
        <p>
        To help save you time (I know, we&#x02bc;re so nice), we give you
        access to the
        <a href="/cloudformation.json" target="_blank">CloudFormation
          template</a> used to deploy your infrastructure. The only thing
        you care about in there is the
        <a
          href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-init.html"
          target="_blank"><code>AWS::CloudFormation::Init</code></a>
        section under of each instance&#x02bc;s metadata (found in
        <code>Resources/</code><span class="placeholder"><code>{hostname}</code></span><code>/Metadata</code>,
        where the <span class="placeholder"><code>{hostname}</code></span> is one
        of the names given above).
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="doc-item" id="deploying">
        <h2>Deploying your infrastructure</h2>
        <p>
        Prior to the official kick-off, we will send you a unique token
        which you can use to start your deployment (it takes about 20
        minutes). After it is done and the challenge has officially kicked
        off, you will be able to download your unique SSH private key,
        unique admin portal and database passwords, your
        <code>toolbox</code>&#x02bc;s public IP address, and a unique XSS
        token (used so we can detect your XSS, see
        <a href="#scoring-detection" target="_self">Detection</a> below).
        </p>
        <p>
        You are asked to set a password prior to deploying, this will let
        you login here and use
        <a href="/hints" target="_blank">hints</a> as well as retrieve your
        access files/passwords.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="doc-item" id="access">
        <h2>Accessing your infrastructure</h2>
        <p>
        When deployment is done, you will get an SSH configuration file
        (<code>ssh_config</code>) and an SSH private key with no passphrase
        (<code>csc20_id_rsa</code>). Move the SSH private key to
        <code>~/.ssh/</code> and append the SSH configuration to your
        current SSH configuration:
        </p>

        <pre><code>mv /path/to/downloaded/csc20_id_rsa ~/.ssh/</code>
<code>chmod 400 ~/.ssh/csc20_id_rsa</code>
<code>cat /path/to/downloaded/ssh_config &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/config</code></pre>
        Note that if you download the files through Google Chrome, it will
        append <code>.txt</code> to the filename.
        &#xaf;\_(&#x30c4;)_/&#xaf;

        <h3 id="access-proxy">Setting up the proxy</h3>
        <p>
        The five hosts in the private subnet can be accessed via SSH by
        proxying via <code>NAT</code>. <code>NAT</code> is accessible only
        from a small set of whitelisted IP addresses, so you will need to
        proxy via our dedicated proxy server. For SSHing into it or any of
        the other hosts, you do not need to do anything special, as the SSH
        configuration file takes everything into account. However, in order
        to access the web applications, yours and others&#x02bc;, in any
        other way (browser, other scanning tools), you need to setup
        a SOCKS proxy. The <code>toolbox</code> host is already setup to
        transparently proxy all non-local traffic, so you don&#x02bc;t need
        to do anything on it. To access the hosts from your local machine,
        you need to start a SOCKS proxy on some port (for example
        <code>2872</code>) as follows:
        </p>

        <pre><code>ssh -D 2872 -fnN _proxy.cybersecuritychallenge-finale.nz</code></pre>

        <p>
        To tunnel via the proxy you can use
        <a href="https://sshuttle.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html" target="_blank">
        <code>sshuttle</code></a>:
        </p>

        <pre><code>sshuttle -r _proxy.cybersecuritychallenge-finale.nz -x 10.0.0.0/8 -x 172.16.0.0/12 -x 192.168.0.0/16 -x 127.0.0.0/8 0/0</code></pre>

        <p>
        Alternatively, you need to configure whatever application you use
        to go via the SOCKS proxy:
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt>
          <a href="https://portswigger.net/burp" target="_blank">Burp

          <dd>
          Go to Project Options &#x276f; Connections &#x276f; SOCKS Proxy
          and input <code>localhost:2872</code>.
          <span class="open-popup" data-popup-id="proxy-setup-burp">
            See a screenshot</span>.
          </dd>

          <dt>Firefox</dt>
          <dd>Install
          <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxyproxy-standard/" target="_blank">
          FoxyProxy</a>, then click on &#x201c;Add&#x201d; to add a new
          SOCKS5 proxy at <code>localhost:2872</code>. Then click on
          &#x201c;Save &amp; Edit Patterns&#x201d; and add a &#x201c;New
          White&#x201d; for
          <code>*.cybersecuritychallenge-finale.nz</code>. Disable the
          default pattern of <code>*</code>. Click on FoxyProxy&#x02bc;s

          SwitchyOmega</a>, then click on &#x201c;New Profile&#x201d; to
          add a new Proxy profile. Select SOCKS5 as the protocol and
          <code>localhost:2872</code> as the server and port.
          Then create another profile, this time of type
          &#x201c;Switch&#x201d;, add a &#x201c;Host wildcard&#x201d;
          condition for <code>*.cybersecuritychallenge-finale.nz</code> and
          select the SOCKS5 profile you just created. Click on
          &#x201c;Apply changes&#x201d; on the left. Click on
          SwitchyOmega&#x02bc;s icon and select the switch profile.

          </dd>
        </dl>

        <h3 id="access-ssh">Logging into the hosts via SSH</h3>
        <p>
        To SSH to any of the hosts do
        </p>

        <pre><code>ssh </code><span class="placeholder"><code>{host}</code></span><code>.csc</code></pre>

        <p>
        for example:
        </p>

        <pre><code>ssh admin.csc</code></pre>

        <p>
        You will be logged in as user <code>ec2-user</code>. To get a
        <code>root</code> shell do:
        </p>

        <pre><code>sudo bash</code></pre>

        <p>
        Your SSH key is authorized to login as <code>ec2-user</code>
        (<code>ubuntu</code> on <code>toolbox</code>), which has with full
        <code>sudo</code> privileges on the five hosts, as well as your
        <code>toolbox</code>, but can only proxy via <code>NAT</code>, i.e.
        you cannot, and do not need to, get a shell on <code>NAT</code>.
        </p>

        <h3 id="access-browser">Accessing the webapp via a browser</h3>
        <p>
        The URLs for the public and admin side of the service desk web
        application are as follows:
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt>public frontend</dt>
          <dd><code>https://</code><span class="placeholder"><code>{your username}</code></span><code>.cybersecuritychallenge-finale.nz/tickets</code></dd>

          <dt>admin portal</dt>
          <dd><code>https://</code><span class="placeholder"><code>{your username}</code></span><code>.cybersecuritychallenge-finale.nz/admin</code></dd>
        </dl>

        <p>
        Your admin account&#x02bc;s username is the same as the username
        you registered here, and the password is as given to you after
        deployment (as &#x201c;Admin password&#x201d;).
        </p>

        <p>
        To access (and start hacking!) other people&#x02bc;s webapps, just
        use their username instead. Their name on the
        <a href="/scoreboard" target="_blank">scoreboard</a> will link to
        their domain too.
        </p>

        <h3 id="access-db">Accessing your database</h3>
        <p>
        You can login directly to your database by SSHing to <code>db</code>
        and running the following:
        </p>

        <pre><code>mysql -h db -u root -p</code></pre>

        <p>
        Use the password given to you after deployment (as &#x201c;DB
        password&#x201d;).
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="doc-item" id="managing">
        <h2>Fixing your infrastructure</h2>
        <p>
        You have full <code>root</code> privileges on the five vulnerable
        hosts so you can change whatever you like.
        </p>

        <h3 id="managing-docker">Rebuilding docker containers</h3>
        <p>
        All hosts except <code>db</code> run a web server inside a
        <a href="https://docs.docker.com/reference/"
           target="_blank">docker</a> container. The source code and
        <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/"
           target="_blank"><code>Dockerfile</code></a> are in
        <code>/media/app</code> (which you would know if you inspected the
        CloudFormation template &#x1f609;).
        </p>

        <p>
        After making changes to the code or <code>Dockerfile</code> you can
        rebuild and restart the container by running:
        </p>

        <pre><code>service csc-docker update</code></pre>

        <p>
        The service takes its configuration from
        <code>/etc/default/csc-docker</code> which you may also want to
        inspect and change...
        </p>

        <p>
        The <code>csc-docker</code> service knows other actions too, except
        for <code>update</code>. For example, <code>status</code>,
        <code>restart</code>, <code>logs</code>, <code>attach</code> (to
        get a shell inside) and others.
        </p>

        <p>
        After rebuilding docker images many times you may get a "No space
        left on device" error. Just run <code>docker system prune</code>.
        </p>

        <h3 id="managing-reset">Resetting an instance to its default</h3>
        <p>
        If something goes horribly wrong and you need to start clean you
        can reset the whole instance by running the following command:
        </p>

        <pre><code>$(awk -F= '/^action=/ {sub(/^action=/, ""); print}' /etc/cfn/hooks.d/cfn-auto-reloader.conf)</code></pre>

        <p>
        Note that any changes you&#x02bc;ve made will be overridden.
        </p>

        <p>Also note that this won&#x02bc;t reset the database. To do this you
        need to either run <code>DROP DATABASE tickets;</code> in the MySQL
        shell or stop the MySQL server and delete its directories by
        running <code>rm -rf /var/lib/mysql* /var/log/mysql*</code>. After
        deleting the database you can run the following command on the
        <code>db</code> host:
        </p>

        <pre><code>/usr/local/bin/setup_db.py DBPassword_</code><span class="placeholder"><code>{your username}</code></span><code> ap-southeast-2</code></pre>

        <p>
        Please don&#x02bc;t abuse this to remove to remove data submitted by your
        opponents and only use it if the database becomes corrupted or
        otherwise unusable. Play fair.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="doc-item" id="scoring">
        <h2>Scoring</h2>
        <p>

        <p>
        Some &#x201c;ownages&#x201d; you report to us manually via one of
        the menu options in the
        <a href="/scoreboard" target="_blank">scoreboard</a>, while
        some other ownages we detect automatically, via a script which runs
        every few minutes (see
        <a href="#monitoring" target="_self">Our monitoring</a> below).
        Your score will be updated every time the script runs or you report
        an ownage. The first time you exploit a given vulnerability, you
        will get maximum points. On subsequent occurences, if the script
        detects again that your victim hasn&#x02bc;t fixed it, you get some
        extra points (roughly a quarter of the maximum points).
        </p>

        <p>
        Here&#x02bc;s an overview of how we confirm an ownage:

        <dl>
          <dt>XSS</dt>
          <dd>
          Your injected script should define a global (i.e. under
          <code>window</code>) variable with the same name as the XSS token
          you got. Our script will look for it. The value can be anything
          (other than <code>undefined</code>) and is ignored. You get more
          points if your payload runs when the page loads without any
          browsing required (i.e. without the need to view any ticket
          messages). You get persistence for this ownage everytime our
          script reloads the victim&#x02bc;s page and detects your XSS.

          <dd>
          You can either report this manually or let us detect it.
          To report manually, retrieve the SHA256 sum of
          <code>/etc/passwd</code> and report it
          via &#x201c;I got RCE&#x201d; in the
          <a href="/scoreboard" target="_blank">scoreboard</a>.
          <br>
          If you want us to auto-detect it the next time our monitoring
          script runs, then connect via TCP to <code>connback.csc</code>
          (which just points to <code>NAT</code>&#x02bc;s private IP
          address) on port <code>49001</code>, and send your name (exactly
          as is, no spaces and same capitalization). You can for example
          use <code>netcat</code>:
          <pre><code>nc connback.csc 49001</code>
<code>myname[Enter]</code></pre>
          You should receive an &#x201c;OK&#x201d; in response.
          <br>
          If <code>netcat</code> is not available (e.g. you&#x02bc;re
          inside a limited docker) or you don&#x02bc;t want to occupy your
          terminal session with a foreground process, then you can use some
          bash magic:
          <pre><code>exec 3&lt;&gt;/dev/tcp/connback.csc/49001</code>
<code>echo myname &gt;&amp;3</code></pre>
          Check if you got OK with:
          <pre><code>cat &lt;&amp;3</code></pre>
          It is safe to stop the <code>cat</code> process with Ctrl-C
          afterwards, the shell will keep file descriptor 3 open.
          <br>
          <span class="emph">If you want to get persistence you must keep

          <dt>Admin account takeover</dt>
          <dd>
          If you got the plaintext admin password, report it to us via
          &#x201c;I got admin creds&#x201d; in the
          <a href="/scoreboard" target="_blank">scoreboard</a>. You do

        <h3 id="scoring-persistence">Persistence</h3>
        <p>
        For some vulnerabilities, you also get points for persistence,
        which adds to your total score. The persistence score depends on
        the number of times our script detected your ownage without
        interruption. The longer the chain of consecutive detections, the
        more points. Are you ready for some maths? In particular, each
        ownage (defined by a unique triple of vulnerability, hacker and
        victim) gets persistence points equal to the sum over all sets of
        consecutive detections (<code>&gt; 1</code>) of <code>1.2^(
        </code><i><code>num. of consecutive detections</code></i><code>
        - 1 )</code>. This adds to the total score of the hacker a weighted
        score of <code>persistence points &#xd7; max points for this
        vulnerability / 2.5</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
        What this means is that you will get an extra 100% of the maximum
        vulnerability points if you persist for half an hour, 300% if you
        persist for an hour and 2,660% if you persist for two hours!
        </p>

        <h3 id="scoring-hints">Hints</h3>
        <p>
        We aimed to have a good mix of easy, medium and (quite) difficult
        to find and exploit vulnerabilities. In fact, some of the
        vulnerabilities are so tricky that we don&#x02bc;t expect you to be
        able to exploit, or even find, them in the time given, so
        <span class="emph">do make use of the
        <a href="/hints" target="_blank">hints</a></span>, they are
        <span class="emph">quite</span> helpful.
        </p>

        <p>
        When you use a hint, no penalty is applied immediately. Rather
        a certain percentage (as indicated on the &#x201c;HELP!&#x201d;
        button) will be deducted from the points you receive
        <span class="emph">if and when </span>you exploit this
        vulnerability. The weighted persistence score for this
        vulnerability will also be scaled by the same percentage.
        </p>

      <div class="doc-item" id="monitoring">
        <h2>Our monitoring</h2>
        <p>
        We have a script (hosted externally) which monitors the admin web
        portal of each participant and checks for XSS. It also clicks on
        each message&#x02bc;s &#x201c;Is this phishy?&#x201d; button in the
        admin portal, in order to validate the message against
        <code>validator</code>. This means that any payloads (XSS or
        otherwise) that you inject into your opponents&#x02bc; applications
        will be triggered within a few minutes, regardless if the
        &#x201c;victim&#x201d; is browsing their site (we are browsing on
        their behalf).
        </p>

        <h3 id="monitoring-penalty">Penalties</h3>
        <p>
        Our script uses its own dedicated user (called <code>aura</code>).
        If for any reason our script is unable to browse your
        applications <span class="emph">you will be penalised</span>. Every
        time the script runs, if it can&#x02bc;t connect or parse the page
        properly a small amount will be deducted from your score. If it can
        parse the page, but the login request returns 401 (meaning our user
        was modified or deleted), the penalty is higher.
        </p>

        <p>
        We display scoreboard results in real time (updated every time our
        script runs, or everytime someone reports their ownage).
        It&#x02bc;s up to <span class="emph">you</span> to check that the
        scoreboard detects your exploit and updates your score. If you
        think the script should have detected your XSS or whatever when it
        hasn&#x02bc;t, talk to us.

        And one more tip from us. If you&#x02bc;ve spawned a reverse shell
        and want to prevent it from being killed when its parent process
        ends, you can put it in the background and <code>disown</code> it:
        </p>

        <pre><code>bash -c '</code><span class="placeholder">reverse shell stuff</span><code> &amp; sleep 1; disown -h %%'</code></pre>
