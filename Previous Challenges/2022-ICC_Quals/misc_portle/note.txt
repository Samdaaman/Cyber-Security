You thought you were pretty good at Wordle aye? Are you this fast though? Portle is a Wordle look-alike where you have to guess the correct port!

If you guess an incorrect digit, a '-' will appear in the guessed position If you guess the right digit, but in the wrong spot, a '+' will appear in the guessed position If you guess the right digit in the right spot, a '=' will appear in the guessed position

You have 5 seconds to solve each round, and there are 5 rounds to solve... Good luck!
