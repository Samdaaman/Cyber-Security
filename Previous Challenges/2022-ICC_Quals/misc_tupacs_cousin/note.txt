Tupac had a lot of relatives. Pam. Bee-Pee SK. Tuqam. But his cousin, fourqam, was his favourite. He was his favourite because they both liked the same book growing up - 50 shades of gray coding.

They used to radio messages to each other all the time - but it seems Tupac's last broadcast was a little hazy... Figure out what the last message Tupac sent to his cousin was before he died.

NOTE: MSB first.
